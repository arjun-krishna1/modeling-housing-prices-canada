note right: NUM_YEARS, NUM_PARCELS, NUM_PEOPLE, NUM_REALIZATIONS

:Configure Scenario Parameters;
note right
  Baseline: Current zoning
  Moderate Upzoning: 1.5x density in SF zones
  Greater Upzoning: 2.0x density in SF zones
end note

' Agent Initialization
:Initialize Parcel Agents;
note left
  Set zoning type
  Calculate density_allowed
  Set land_value and improvement_value
  Set units = 1
end note

:Initialize People Agents;
note right
  Set income
  Calculate savings
  Set initial role = 'renter'
end note

:Assign Initial Properties;
note left
  Match renters with properties
  they can afford
  Update roles to 'homeowner'

    Sentiment affected by:
    - Interest rates
    - Inflation
    - Random market factors
  end note
  
  ' People agent updates
  :Update People Agents;

:Aggregate Results Across Realizations;
note left
  Calculate statistical measures:
  - Median values
